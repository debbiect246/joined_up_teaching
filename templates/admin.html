            <h2>Creating zones</h2>
            <p>You must create a space for every piece of paper that comes your way so that you know where everything is and can find it quickly. One way to do this is by setting up zones. Zones are specific spaces that are divided up based on specific activities conducted in the space. Before you decide what zones you want to set up, first ask yourself what level of organization you want. Will you be happy with a few neat piles, or do you need everything visible?</p>
